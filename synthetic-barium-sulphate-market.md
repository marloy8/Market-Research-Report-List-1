<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Barium Sulphate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Precipitated Barium Sulfate (D50>0.5μm）</li><li>Ultra - fine Precipitated Barium Sulfate (D50≤0.5μm）</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The synthetic barium sulphate market can be categorized into two types: precipitated barium sulfate with a particle size greater than 0.5μm and ultra-fine precipitated barium sulfate with a particle size less than or equal to 0.5μm. Precipitated barium sulfate refers to the production method where barium sulfate is obtained through a chemical process. Ultra-fine precipitated barium sulfate, on the other hand, implies that the particle size of the barium sulfate is very small. These distinctions are important in understanding the different properties and applications of synthetic barium sulphate.</p></p>

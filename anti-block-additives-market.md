<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-block Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic</li><li>Organic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-block additives are materials used in the manufacturing process to prevent sticking or blocking of surfaces, particularly in packaging materials such as films and coatings. Inorganic anti-block additives are typically composed of mineral-based substances like silica or talc. These additives create microscopic roughness on the surface, reducing adhesion. Organic anti-block additives, on the other hand, are derived from natural or synthetic polymers. They work by forming a lubricating layer between surfaces, preventing them from sticking together. Both inorganic and organic anti-block additives serve the same purpose, but they have different chemical compositions and mechanisms of action.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVC Foam Sheet for Structural Composites Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cell</li><li>Closed Cell</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PVC foam sheets are widely used in structural composites due to their lightweight, strong, and durable characteristics. These sheets come in two types: open cell and closed cell. Open cell PVC foam sheets contain interconnected cells, allowing air and water to pass through, making them suitable for applications requiring water drainage or breathability. Closed cell PVC foam sheets have sealed cells, making them impermeable to air and water, thus ideal for applications requiring buoyancy, insulation, or airtightness. Both types offer excellent versatility and are widely used in construction, marine, transportation, and other industries.</p></p>

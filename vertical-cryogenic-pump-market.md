<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Cryogenic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Non-Submersible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vertical cryogenic pump market is divided into two main types: submersible and non-submersible pumps. Submersible pumps are designed to be immersed directly in cryogenic liquids such as liquid nitrogen or oxygen, allowing for efficient and reliable transfer of these fluids. On the other hand, non-submersible pumps are placed outside the cryogenic storage tank and rely on a separate suction line to draw in the cryogenic liquid for pumping. Both types of pumps are important in the cryogenic industry, with submersible pumps being preferred for their direct immersion capability.</p></p>

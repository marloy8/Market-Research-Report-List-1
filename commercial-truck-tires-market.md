<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Truck Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diagonal Tires</li><li>Radial Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial truck tires can be classified into two main types: diagonal tires and radial tires. Diagonal tires are constructed with layers of plies that run at an angle to the centerline of the tread. These tires provide good traction and are more affordable, but they tend to have higher rolling resistance and less stability at high speeds. On the other hand, radial tires have layers of plies that run radially across the tire. These tires offer better fuel efficiency, improved stability, and longer tread life, although they are usually more expensive.</p></p>

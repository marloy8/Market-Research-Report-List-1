<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Vehicle OE Shock Absorbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Twin-tube Type</li><li>Mono-tube Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Light Vehicle OE Shock Absorbers Market includes two common types: Twin-tube Type and Mono-tube Type. Twin-tube shock absorbers have two tubes, one inside the other. The outer tube, known as the reservoir tube, holds the hydraulic fluid, while the inner tube, referred to as the working tube, houses the piston valve. In contrast, Mono-tube shock absorbers have a single tube that contains both the hydraulic fluid and the piston valve. Both types serve the purpose of damping the vehicle's vibrations and providing a smoother ride.</p></p>

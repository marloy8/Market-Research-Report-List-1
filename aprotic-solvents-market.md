<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aprotic Solvents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dipolar Aprotic Solvent</li><li>Inert Solvent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aprotic solvents are a type of organic solvents that do not contain acidic protons. These solvents can be classified into two main categories: dipolar aprotic solvents and inert solvents. Dipolar aprotic solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and acetonitrile, have a strong dipole moment and can dissolve a wide range of organic compounds. Inert solvents, like hexane and toluene, are less polar and are commonly used as diluents or solvents for non-polar substances. Both types play crucial roles in various industries, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and electronics.</p></p>

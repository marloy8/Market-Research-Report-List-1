<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Suspension System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Automotive Suspension System</li><li>Non-independent Automotive Suspension System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Suspension System market comprises two main types: independent and non-independent. Independent Automotive Suspension System refers to a setup where each wheel is mounted to its own suspension system, allowing them to move independently of each other. This type offers better ride comfort, handling, and stability. On the other hand, Non-independent Automotive Suspension System refers to a setup where the wheels on each axle are connected by a solid axle or connected through a torsion beam. This type is more cost-effective but generally provides a slightly stiffer ride and lower handling capabilities.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mono-Antibody (mAb) for HER2-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pertuzumab</li><li>Trastuzumab</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The mono-antibody (mAb) market for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer includes two types: Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab. Pertuzumab is a targeted therapy that blocks the HER2 receptor, preventing the growth and division of cancer cells. Trastuzumab, on the other hand, attaches to the HER2 receptor, inhibiting cancer cell growth and triggering an immune response against the cancer cells. Both drugs are used in combination with chemotherapy to treat HER2-positive advanced breast cancer patients, reducing tumor growth and improving overall survival rates.</p></p>

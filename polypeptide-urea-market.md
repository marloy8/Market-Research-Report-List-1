<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polypeptide Urea Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Particle Polypeptide Urea</li><li>Large Particle Polypeptide Urea</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polypeptide urea refers to a type of organic compound that is commonly used in the manufacturing of fertilizers. The market for polypeptide urea can be classified into two types: small particle polypeptide urea and large particle polypeptide urea. Small particle polypeptide urea is characterized by its fine texture, which ensures a quick release of nutrients into soil. On the other hand, large particle polypeptide urea has a coarser texture, allowing for a slower and more controlled release of nutrients. Both types of polypeptide urea serve the purpose of providing essential nutrients to plants and improving soil fertility.</p></p>

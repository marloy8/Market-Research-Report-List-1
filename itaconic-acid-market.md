<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Itaconic Acid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synthesis</li><li>Fermentation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Itaconic Acid is commercially produced through two different methods: synthesis and fermentation. Synthesis involves the chemical reaction of maleic anhydride with various raw materials, such as ethylene, whereas fermentation involves the use of microorganisms like Aspergillus terreus to convert sugars (such as glucose) into itaconic acid. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Synthesis enables large-scale production and high purity, but it consumes non-renewable resources. On the other hand, fermentation is more sustainable as it uses renewable resources, but it has lower yield and requires more time and expertise.</p></p>

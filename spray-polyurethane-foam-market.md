<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spray Polyurethane Foam Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Cell</li><li>Closed-Cell</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spray Polyurethane Foam (SPF) is a versatile insulation material used in various applications. It is categorized into two types: Open-Cell and Closed-Cell. Open-Cell foam has open cells, allowing air to fill the spaces within the insulation, making it less dense. It provides effective thermal insulation and soundproofing but has a lower resistance to moisture. On the other hand, Closed-Cell foam has closed cells, making it denser and more moisture-resistant. It provides superior thermal insulation, structural support, and acts as a vapor barrier. Both types have unique properties and are chosen based on specific project requirements.</p></p>

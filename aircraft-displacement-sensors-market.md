<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Displacement Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Aircraft displacement sensors are used for measuring the position or movement of aircraft components. The market for these sensors can be classified into two types: non-contact type and contact type. Non-contact type sensors measure displacement without physical contact and often use technologies like ultrasonic, laser, or capacitive sensing. They are ideal for applications where precision and sensitivity are paramount. Contact type sensors, on the other hand, rely on physical contact with the aircraft component to measure displacement. They are usually more robust and suitable for harsh environments but may have limitations in terms of sensitivity and accuracy.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EV On Board Battery Charger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional</li><li>Bidirectional</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EV On Board Battery Charger market can be categorized into two types: unidirectional and bidirectional chargers. Unidirectional chargers, as the name suggests, only allow charging of the electric vehicle (EV) battery from an external power source. They provide a one-way flow of energy from the power source to the EV battery. On the other hand, bidirectional chargers enable the flow of energy in both directions, allowing not only charging of the battery but also discharge. This makes bidirectional chargers valuable for applications such as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems, where EVs can feed excess stored energy back into the grid.</p></p>

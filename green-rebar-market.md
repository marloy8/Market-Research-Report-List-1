<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Green Rebar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The green rebar market consists of two main types: deformed steel and mild steel. Deformed steel rebar is characterized by its ridges, bumps, or indentations that provide better grip and bonding with concrete, making it ideal for construction in earthquake-prone areas. On the other hand, mild steel rebar has a smooth surface and is commonly used for smaller, less demanding construction projects. Both types of rebar are important in the construction industry and serve different purposes based on their specific characteristics.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tubeless Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial</li><li>Bias</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive tubeless tire market is segmented into two types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires have layers of cords running radially from bead to bead, providing improved grip, fuel efficiency, and durability. They are commonly used in passenger cars and commercial vehicles. On the other hand, bias tires have cords layered diagonally to the direction of travel, offering better load-carrying capacity and resistance to damage. They are suitable for off-road vehicles and heavy-duty applications such as construction and mining. The choice between these two types depends on the specific needs and requirements of the vehicle and its usage.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prepreg Tape</li><li>Dry Tape</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Carbon fiber tape market includes two main types: prepreg tape and dry tape. Prepreg tape is created by impregnating carbon fiber with a polymer resin, resulting in a ready-to-use product that requires curing at specific temperatures. This type offers better uniformity, higher strength, and is widely used in industries like aerospace and automotive. On the other hand, dry tape consists of carbon fiber strands that are woven together without any resin. It offers flexibility for customization and is often used in manual layup applications where resin infusion is done later. Both types have their own advantages and applications within the carbon fiber market.</p></p>

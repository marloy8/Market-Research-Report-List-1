<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Brake Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Copper Free Ceramic Brake Pads</li><li>Copper-bearing Ceramic Brake Pad</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ceramic brake pads are classified into two main types - copper free ceramic brake pads and copper-bearing ceramic brake pads. Copper free ceramic brake pads do not contain copper as a component, making them more environmentally friendly and reducing the risks of copper deposition on brake components. On the other hand, copper-bearing ceramic brake pads contain copper, which improves their performance in terms of friction, heat transfer, and durability. However, the use of copper in these pads can lead to environmental concerns and potential health hazards.</p></p>

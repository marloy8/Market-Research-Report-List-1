<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Commercial Vehicle Brake Caliper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston Caliper</li><li>Multi-Piston Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Heavy Commercial Vehicle Brake Caliper market is divided into two types: Single Piston Caliper and Multi-Piston Caliper. Single Piston Caliper refers to a brake caliper with a single piston responsible for exerting pressure on the brake pads, which then makes contact with the brake rotor. On the other hand, Multi-Piston Caliper has multiple pistons that distribute the braking force more evenly across the brake pads, resulting in improved braking performance, stability, and efficiency.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnesium-chromite Bricks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sintering</li><li>Direct-bonded</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Magnesium-chromite bricks are used for lining furnaces and kilns due to their high thermal resistance. There are two types of markets for these bricks: sintering and direct-bonded. </p><p>1) Sintering market involves the process of heating the bricks at high temperatures to fuse the particles together, creating a strong bond. This method enhances the bricks' durability and resistance to erosion.</p><p>2) Direct-bonded market, on the other hand, relies on chemical reactions between the magnesia and chromite to form a direct bond, resulting in a reliable and resilient brick lining. This method eliminates the need for excessive heating and ensures a cost-effective solution.</p></p>
